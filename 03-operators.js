// Task: Learn basic arithmetic and assignment operators

// 1. Define two variables a = 10 and b = 4
let a = 10;
let b = 4;

// 2. addition
let sum = a + b;

// 3. subtraction
let diff = a - b;

// 4. multiplication
let product = a * b;

// 5. division
let quotient = a / b;

// 6. Log all results to the console
console.log("sum =", sum);
console.log("diff =", diff);
console.log("product =", product);
console.log("quotient =", quotient);

// 7. other ways to do operations
a += 1; // increment a by 1, same as a = a + 1
++a; // increment a by 1, same as a = a + 1
a++; // increment a by 1, same as a = a + 1
// same works with other operators: -=, --, *=, ** etc.
